The repeated use of opto-jump testing is something that is probably additional to normal training and testing.
The ethics form mentions ""at each game""; how many games are we talking about?
Does the testing require participants to come in 48 hours and 72 hours post match, just to be tested or are they therefore training purposes anyway (the Wednesday training sessions seem to be ok but the Tuesday ""day release"" is problematic if they are not training on this day.
Technically this is not using the named protocol because the opto jump means that what is being done is not purely a subset of the protocol.  Therefore a fuller description of the test is required.
Replace ANNOVA with ANOVA.
If multiple matches are being used should this be a two-way repeated measures ANOVA or are the researchers planning to analyse non-independent data; ie using the same individuals more than once in the data set.

• Provide social media advert.
• Provide confirmation of permission from university.
• Where will testing take place?
• As a longitudinal study need to keep identifying data separate from questionnaire data.  How will you keep personal data separate from responses? (ethics form and information sheet)
• Exclusion criteria – shouldn’t take part if you are or think you may be clinically depressed.
• To avoid excluding individuals and having to explain why you are not including them, we suggest giving all participants the BDI if they agree to take part.
• Information Sheet – inform that participant will be telephoned and when. Clarify that by continuing to take part, participants are agreeing to the remainder of the testing.
• We weren’t clear about the various methods and procedures so we would appreciate it if it could be made simpler.
• As the main purpose of the study is looking at the 5-factor model and interventions for positivity, there doesn’t seem a need for the BDI. If there is such a need then please justify it in non-technical summary. If there isn’t a need then please remove all reference to BDI and depression.
• There doesn’t seem to be a reason for asking questions or what you will do with the answers. If they are unnecessary then please remove them. If they are necessary then include the questions and what you will do with that information – analysis?
• Online study – consent is assumed through continued participation.  Include that through beginning the study you are agreeing to continued participation with the study 1 week, 1 month on, including contact by telephone.
• Provide support links – student services, counselling service, for example.
• Benefits – only state ‘will benefit an undergraduate project’.
• Who will see the data?
• How can participants withdraw their data?

The only other requests are as follows:

·       Whilst it is appropriate to gain consent from the school Head in loco parentis, the researcher needs to include a contact letter to the School (requesting loco parentis) and the School’s response (evidence of the agreement for the study to go ahead and confirmation that the process meets with the their own internal procedures). These letters need to be included as attachments at the end of the application form.
·       The researcher also needs to include a copy of his DBS form.

If you can return an amended version of the application to sportethics@cardiffmet.ac.uk, it will be returned to the original reviewer to check and for interim panel Chair to approve. This is likely to be Rachel Lord until a new Chair is appointed.

The grounds for this decision were based on the following reservations:

•	Proposed study design and method will not address the study aims. 
•	There is some conceptual confusion regarding the subject focus of the study which is potentially sensitive. 
•	The panel was uncertain whether the subject, combined with the open-ended nature of a questionnaire, was suitable given the student’s (and supervisor’s) knowledge and experience in the area of mental health.  

The panel had a long discussion about how Sam could refocus his study. The recommendation is for Sam to adopt a case-study approach to that the to explore ‘older adults’ perceptions on the role of participating in competitive sport in supporting their general wellbeing.  Framed in this way, the project maybe suitable for supervisor sign-off.

The form contains a lot of useful information to help explain the general design, some of the risks and you have explained how you will minimise these risks. There are however a number of concerns which led to our decision to reject the submission for major amendments and then resubmit. 

1) We encourage you to think of timescales here. At the moment we don’t know if you have premission to run this study or not but you need to gain a letter of approval from the school, then you need to send our the consent forms to the parents and assent forms for the children and get these back before collecting any data. All of this will take a considerable amount of time and you only have 4 months before submission. You would encourage you to consider whether writing a theoretical study is more appropriate or perhaps using the staff and exploring their experiences.

2) There are some fundamental issues with using a Foucauldian analysis to explore the structures and external factors on participant engagement when you and the Head of PE are in the room. You two may have a significant influence on participation and the participants may not feel comfortable divulging this information (whether positive or perhaps more negative). 

Our other concerns revolved around:
-	You need to include consent forms and PI sheet for the parents, head of PE and then include your assent form for the children.
-	You need to include a section on your procedures. How will you contact the participants? Where will you get their emails from? Where are the focus groups taking place, what is the structure of the focus group, what questions will you ask? 
-	You need to add more information about the risks (e.g., anonymity) and we have made specific comments on the ethics application.

If you want to go through any of this then please let us know and we will work with you.

We will also send a copy of your application via email with comments.

Firstly, although the project is very interesting, we do not feel that there is a sufficient reason for doing this research. That is, what is the rationale for this study to take place based on relevant literature?

Secondly, given the sensitive nature of the topic, it is paramount that safety and well being of both participants and researchers are considered in detail. Exclusion criteria need to be stated so that participants can self-exclude at the outset thus minimising any potential triggering information. What specialist support is in place for participants who experience distress at thinking and/or disclosing sensitive information? What support is in place for researchers who may feel distress at hearing/reading accounts of sensitive information? Third, what relevant experience does the supervisor have with respect to this research area? The ethics panel and the potential participants need to feel confident that there is sufficient and appropriate experience that this research will be conducted professionally, ethically, and sensitively.

In general, there is much information that is omitted from the application and rather than the panel commenting on each piece, we would recommend that you follow the guidance we have previously you regarding how to complete our ethics form, consent form, and Information Sheet.

The general outline of the project was ok and relatively easy to follow. However, there are a number of, relatively simple, aspects to address. Although having said that given the current climate the design of the project will probably need to be changed. As a team you’re probably already having discussions around the module and research design so the attached document and my general comments below maybe redundant. If they are not then when you address our comments and make changes to the document please can you use track changes and also add a comment to ours to explain if you addressed the point and how you did that or if you have not addressed it then explain why. Some general comments are:
 
-          You need to think about explaining the research design in a little more detail at times. For example, you noted the baseline data collection phase but then did not explain what data you were collecting.
-          The research design and PI sheet were not consistent at times and/or information was missing. For instance, you noted that a validation group were being formed to discuss the data but then did not outline this in the PI sheet.
-          The last two general comments mean that there are a number of risks you need to identify and/or explain some of the risks you noted in more detail.
-          You also need to include a withdrawal form and then consider what this means for how the participants can withdraw their data (e.g., when can they withdraw their data by, how will you withdraw some data from your notes or observations?).
-          Finally, I know you’re an employer of the pool facilities but your researcher role extends this beyond your normal duties. Therefore, you need to include a letter of permission from the organisation that this research can take place.

It is an outward facing document with a few typing mistakes and grammar that will need adjusting. 
GDPR – this could be different in America, therefore this may need to be addressed differently, so compliance with both GDPR in the UK and America. The option for parents needs to be opt ‘In’ not opt ‘Out’ – see comment on the document attached – RL is happy to discuss this as Chair. 
The paper medical records will need to be disposed of once transferred to onedrive, this needs to be mentioned on sheet. No mention of how maturity will be assessed, this needs to be done sensitively, a statement could be added “this will be done in a sensitive manner, recorded by researcher and not shared with the group.” 
Participants should be offered the opportunity to participate in this study, at the moment the phrasing seems to suggest that people will be chosen at random. 
At this moment in time we have the COVID-19 outbreak, therefore it would be good to mention that data collection will comply with what countries restrictions are in place at the time of taking the data, i.e. physical distancing.

That might be the case if everything is fine, but if answering the questions distils the disquiet felt by a participant, I think they could feel rather upset.  I wouldn’t change the questions per se, but I would want the researcher to be a little more concerned about how the participant might feel and give some signposting to help that might be available.

•	Please explain how participants will be approached/invited to take part and include the recruitment letter/advert in the appendices
•	Where will data collection take place - face to face/online - not specified.
•	Include information pertaining to withdrawal of data post-study (how long permitted)
C1 & C2: 
•	This could potentially be a sensitive topic (e.g. victims of financial ruin etc.) so should acknowledge this in risks and signpost helplines etc.
Information sheet: 
•	Please reword the background section to ensure that this is understandable for a lay audience and does not lead participants by specifying the hypothesised association
•	The arrangements for protecting anonymity are not entirely clear in the information sheet. Once data from trading records and questionnaires have been linked, there should then be no need to retain any identifiable data to compare individuals. This also raises the question of how their intraday trading records will be retrieved, and will their employers therefore be aware that they are participating in the study? 
•	Potential risks and sources of support should anyone have concerns about issues raised in the study should be included in the information sheet
•	Remove ‘you will also learn about financial self-efficacy’ from the potential benefits section
•	Please amend the statement ‘only age and gender will be collected’ in the ‘How we protect your privacy’ section as this may be confusing given that other questions and trading data are being collected
Consent form
•	Ensure the statement relating to links with identity is accurate, please see comments above regarding linkage of trading data & questionnaire data
•	The statement relating to deception is not required unless it is relevant to the study

PIS – needs Cardiff Met header and ethics reference number 
Correct start and approximate end dates 
It is not clear whether this an electronic questionnaire – PIS says it will be ‘ sent to you’ – does this mean the link? 
Details of withdrawal need to be specific, dates are vague and reference to the ‘tedious task’ on the part of the researcher are inappropriate. 
Emailing the participant again to clarify responses is not appropriate, especially as anonymity is assured – how will they know whose response is unclear? 
Remove reference to  ‘perfect data’  
Supervisor’s email incorrect 
Mixed methods is talked about but the ethics form seems to describe only a Qualtrics questionnaire? 
Withdrawal process needs to be very clear – the withdrawal form is not appropriate in this instance. It should be clarified that withdrawal can occur at any point until the questionnaire is complete, by stopping answering the questions. Once the q is submitted no withdrawal is possible. Consent can be similarly taken at the start of the Q.

A3: The interviews are listed as taking place at the participant’s home. If this means via Teams, that needs to be specified. If this implies a researcher visit to individual homes, this is a much more serious safety risk and needs to be elaborated on.

“Are there any risks associated with taking part” provide helplines here.

A3 – ‘Reaching saturation’ is a difficult concept to assess in qualitative work, so it would be useful to provide an estimate of the numbers of people you anticipate interviewing. 
Written consent may be difficult to arrange for video interviews – consider audio-recorded verbal consent or return of consent forms via e-mail. 
It would be more secure to conduct the interviews on the password protected laptop and record them directly rather than transferring from a phone. 
Ensure that the process for withdrawing data and redacting specific passages from the transcripts (if applicable) is clearly stated in your procedure section.

How will your participants be invited to take part? 
If interviews are to take place in person where will these take place? Please ensure you consider restrictions relating to COVID-19. How will remote interviews be conducted, e.g. via Zoom or by telephone? 
Is 15-20 minutes sufficient to complete an in-depth interview on this topic? 
It is unclear in the methods whether it is an interview or online survey method that is being used. Please ensure this is clear and consistent. 
How will informed consent be obtained?
Please confirm how long data will be stored for before it is destroyed. 
Withdrawal process – once data has been used in analysis, it isn’t usually possible to withdraw. Ensure that it is clear that after the 2 week period when withdrawal is possible that all data will be anonymised, so it isn’t possible to withdraw after that point. Participants should contact supervisor not student to withdraw. Participants should also be able to withdraw verbally during the interview and should also include an option to redact specific statements should they wish to do so during the interview or the 14 day withdrawal period. 
 
Participant information sheet
Please ensure that any irrelevant information from the template has been removed from this document. 
Please proof read this document as there are several grammatical errors and unclear passages that need to be corrected to ensure that the participants can easily understand the information. 
Remove number of participants from the ‘Why have I been invited’ section as participation is voluntary so it’s possible not all will take part. 
Risks – ensure this is phrased in a way that is appropriate for participants. Remove Principal Investigator as source of help from this section. 
Benefits – state contributing to completion of undergraduate project only. 
Remove student contact details from information sheet – supervisor should be the point of contact.  
Please check your withdrawal and consent forms to ensure that irrelevant information from templates is removed, e.g. there are two identical statements on your withdrawal form.

A3: Will there be some sort of procedure to ensure students whose parents don’t consent don’t take part? In regards to the potential for an online study, is it appropriate to be gathering contact numbers/email addresses for underage students? If parents don’t consent, the ethics form states that students will still complete the forms but the data won’t be used. This is inappropriate- students whose parents don’t consent should not be given the study. To withdraw their data once the survey is done, students must remember their code- how will the researcher ensure this, as right now if a student forgets their code, they can’t withdraw, and the right to withdraw must be guaranteed.

Are there research governance regulations that need to be adhered to locally? For example, in the UK we would require a criminal records check for any researchers working with vulnerable populations such as victims of abuse. 
2. What procedures are in place to make sure that the researcher is safe while carrying out interviews, particularly if these take place face-to-face
3. What emotional support is available to the researcher given that they are likely to be exposed to distressing material? 
4. Are there any exclusion criteria required, e.g. for those experiencing ongoing abuse, currently involved in legal proceedings, or experiencing psychiatric problems (mild depression and anxiety are very common and shouldn’t pose a problem if appropriate support is in place, but people with more severe psychological disorders should probably not participate)? 
5. Would an anonymous survey using a validated childhood adverse events questionnaire be a suitable lower risk alternative? 

The topic you wish to explore is extremely sensitive and you will be involving participants who have suffered child trauma and ask them questions about it. However, the application does not provide any details of the experience of the researcher and/or supervision team to conduct this kind of research. For this reason, the panel would ask you to provide such information or reconsider how you might explore this topic but without involving participants who have experienced childhood trauma. One way could be to ask people about their perceptions of childhood trauma.
The resubmitted application will then be considered in full.

Overall this was a coherent application, which evidenced a basic understanding of the ethical issues associated with the project. That said, there are some areas of development required before this submission can be approved. The project will need to be resubmitted to the ethics panel. 

The ethical issues that need addressing primarily related to the combination of the research methods being used; when, where and why particular methods are used and at what point in the project. Therefore, further explanation of the research methods is needed to help clarify (and justify) potential ethical issues. For instance, reflective diaries are mentioned but there is no indication of the structure and content, particularly when the recording of informal discussion is stated. 

Addressing such issues will also help clarify why the project cannot run if a participant withdraws. In this regard, the panel recommends that stopping the project every time a participant withdraws could be problematic, meaning a more comprehensive engagement with how participants are recruited, sign-up, and withdrawal would significantly strengthen the application. Please note that there are also some specific comments for you to engage with throughout the application. These include issues of data handling, storage, anonymity, confidentiality and consent from the organisation. It is recommended that you include a letter of consent / permission from NGB, Swim Wales (it could be an email). 

We hope you find the comments constructive and useful for the development of your project. We welcome a revised submission.  Please address the comments below and make any amendments via track changes and send to sportethics@cardiffmet.ac.uk.
